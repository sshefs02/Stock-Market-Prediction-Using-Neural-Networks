Stock Market Market using Neural Networks - 

This paper presents the comparative performance analysis of two different neural network structures: Radial basis function network (RBFN) and Multilayer feed forward neural network (MLFFNN) for testing their ability in approximating the unknown nonlinear dynamical functions. Stock market data is highly nonlinear and have been used in this paper for identification purpose.
Both these neural network structures are allowed to train in order to approximate the nonlinear mathematical relationship existing between the inputs and output of stock market price data. 
The parameter update equation was derived using back propagation algorithm based on gradient descent principle.
The simulation results obtained reveals that RBFN based identification model have performed better than that of MLFFNN based identification model.
